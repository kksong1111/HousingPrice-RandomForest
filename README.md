# HousingPrice-RandomForest
Predict House Price using house parameters
House Seller can use this model to get suggested price to sell their house, and buys can use this model to decide the price they offer

In this notebook, we first use the price mean to make predictions. Then we do a linear regression
on house area to predict house price. We then fit our random forest models using n_trees = 50, 80,
100, 200 as hyperparameters. We compare our results predicted using random forests with mean
prediction and linear regression. Lastly, we use our model on test.csv
